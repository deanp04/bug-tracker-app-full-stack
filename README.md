# Bug Tracker
A full stack Bug Tracker application using MVC structure that any team can use to log issues, assign tickets to users, and track progress.

**Video DEMO:** https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Iakio4cUlk

## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** EJS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB

Following MVC structure to create this app, the views are displayed using EJS and Bootstrap. CRUD functionality is utilized for users to post tickets, get information, put changes to the "open/closed" status, and delete tickets.

## Lessons Learned:

I enjoyed the trouble-shooting and problem solving that had to occur as I figured out how to connect the frontend to the backend. Learning to integrate a forEach method with EJS was also cool.

## Next Steps for this Project
Add user authentication with passport and expand features.

## How to use
- Clone or download the code
- npm install
- set up your own .env with DB_CONNECTION = "your mongoDB connection string"
- npm start
- run on localhost:8000
